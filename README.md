## About The Website
‘When choosing a wedding venue, you’ll need to think about the venue’s location, size, and style to make sure it’s a fit for you and your future spouse’s big day. Here is a list of some of the most popular wedding venue types to get you started !‘‘
Our concept is : "Love is fun and should be celebrated. We believe that every love story is as unique as the couple and your wedding should celebrate that from the moment you say “yes!” to the last moment of your wedding send off. If you are looking for a planner who is positive and compassionate with a clear plan, we think you've come to the right place! "
